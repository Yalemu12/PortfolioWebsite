# 🌐 Portfolio Website — Yonnas Alemu

This is my personal **Portfolio Website**, created to showcase my experience, technical skills, and projects as a Computer Science student at **Kennesaw State University**. The site serves as my digital resume and a hub for the work I’ve completed across web development, software engineering, data analytics, and creative technology. It’s fully responsive, visually clean, and optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

Built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project reflects my approach to front-end development — focusing on clarity, accessibility, and design consistency. The portfolio highlights who I am, the tools I use, and the software projects I’ve built, while giving visitors a direct way to contact me or download my resume.
